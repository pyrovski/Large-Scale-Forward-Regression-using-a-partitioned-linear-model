Instructions:

.) Edit the Makefile and set the BLAS_LAPACK_LIB variable
   so that you can link against the BLAS and Lapack on your
   system.

.) Edit the Makefile's GSL_INCLUDE and GSL_LIB variables to point to the
   location of the GSL header files and libraries on your system.

.) Determine the naming scheme used on your system for calling
   Fortran functions from C.  By default, the trailing underscore,
   eg. dgesdd_, is used.  Edit the #defines in my_lapack_blas.h
   appropriately to account for this naming scheme.

.) Type 'make reference_glm'.  This should produce an executable
   called reference_glm.

.) The reference_glm program by default reads the reference_glm.in
   input file to obtain the path the following 3 data files:
   
   a) fixed.effects.nam.sorted.filtered.dat
   b) imputed.marker.chr10.sorted.filtered.dat
   c) residuals.chr10.sorted.dat

   containing the population structure, genotypes, and phenotypes.
   You must specify the appropriate path to these files on your
   system.

.) After running the code with ./reference_glm, the 79 different
   p-values will be computed and displayed to the screen.



Description of files:

  Headers:
  -------
  GetPot - input parsing library header
  fortran_matrix.h - defines the FortranMatrix object used in BLAS/Lapack computations
  glm.h - Defines the main GLM routine (actually 2 routines, one is specialized to a Kt vector)
  inner.h - utility function, computes the inner product between 2 vectors
  my_lapack_blas.h - #defines and function prototypes for the BLAS/Lapack routines used in this code
  print_matrix.h - For printing column-major matrices
  rank.h - Computes the approximate rank of a FortranMatrix (using the SVD) relative to some tolerance
  svd.h - The SVD creation and application routines, used by the GLM for computing pseudoinverses
   
  Source files:
  ------------
  reference_glm.C - The outer loops which call the GLM routine (defined in glm.h)

  Others:
  ------
  reference_glm.in - Input file for reference_glm.C, must contain path, see above for additional details
  Makefile - Set variables, etc for the compilation
  README - This file
