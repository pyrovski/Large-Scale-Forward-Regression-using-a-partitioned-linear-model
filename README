Building:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This application depends on the following:
- MPI
- GSL
- LAPACK
- BLAS

On a Debian-based system, these may be installed as follows:
openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libatlas-base-dev libgsl0-dev

The Makefile is designed to be configured through the LIBRARY_PATHS and, optionally, CUDA_SM files through the Makefile variables BLAS_PATH, GSL_PATH, and so forth.

Running:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The application requires the following inputs:
- Independent variables
- A dependent variable
- Fixed effects

All inputs are expected in binary double-precision, little-endian, column-major matrix format.

The quantity and specification of the above are achieved through command line parameters:

-g <independent variables file>
--num_geno <number of independent variables>
--num_r <length of all independent variables>
-r <dependent variable file>

The following parameters are optional:
-f <fixed effects file>
--num_fixed <number of fixed effects>
-v <verbosity level> : 0, 1, or 2
-e <independent variable p-value entry limit> : the application will cease once the smallest p-value for an iteration exceeds the entry limit
-l <maximum number of iterations>

The application supports MPI.
