The only process that must occur on the CPU is updating of constant 
memory variables, d_G and d_Xty.  The values can be calculated on the 
CPU or the GPU, but the CPU is likely to be faster.

Arguments for updating d_G and d_Xty: 

The rest of compUpdate() will run on the GPU; this consists of updating 
XtSNP.  Use the previously chosen SNP, multiply by all SNPs.

Additional work on the CPU can be the first part of prep; namely, 
applying constructing XtX and applying SVD to XtX.
